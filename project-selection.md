# Selecting Projects for the Global Sprint

Review the [Project Lead info](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/projects/) and [Project Requirements](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/project-requirements/).

### Workflow for Project Registration
1. Project Lead (PL) fills out the [project submission form](https://goo.gl/forms/lvzjKt981TK9P3XQ2). Form includes box to check for Hub association/connection.
2. PL receives email with link to issue template & checklist. Designated Hub Contact (HC) is automatically cc'ed. 
3. PL makes issue; HC is tagged automatically to be notified of the new issue.
4. HC reviews issue, and add labels for tracks, comments and answers questions as needed. 
5. If/when PL completes checklist to be featured project, HC adds project to Network Pulse with Global Sprint tags.

### About Project Leads
The Project Lead role is key for a successful run in the Global Sprint! Strong Leads will be committed to putting in prep time to get their projects ready for contribution and do some promotion. A project's Global Sprint is much more likely to be successful if the Project Lead is good at communicating with newcomers to their project... beginners who may have something to offer but might not be experts on the topic. **We are strongly suggesting that all Project Leads take [Open Leadership 101](), our short (1-hour) online intro to Mozilla, the Network, and working open best practices.**

**TIPS ON SELECTING PROJECTS AND LEADS:**
* You know your communities best, and you'll know those who are best prepared to lead. 
* Reach out to strong community members and invite them to submit projects!
* If an enthusiastic community member is less prepared to lead, point them to [Open Leadership 101](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/open-leadership-101) or modules of the [Open Leadership Training Series](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/) to brush up on skills like documentation, comms, and community building.
* Pair enthusiastic, capable community members who don't have projects with Project Leads who need more help. 


### How to wrangle projects

#### Using labels
Use the GitHub labels to curate the projects in your community/area. You can also add labels that correspond with the Mozilla's issues agenda.

#### Posting to Mozilla Pulse
Once the project lead posts `This is ready for Mozilla Pulse`, check that they have completed all the steps to be a FEATURED project. If all's in order, [post the project to Mozilla Pulse](https://www.mozillapulse.org/add).

* **Title** Use the title of the issue
* **URL** If the project has a landing page, add that here. Otherwise, link to the GitHub repo.
* **Description** Use the description the project lead provided - it should be in the first (top) comment of the issue.
* **Creator(s)** Add the project lead name(s)
* **Why might this be interesting to other people in our network?** Add your own thoughts here. Feel free to leave blank.
* **Tags** Add the tags `mozsprint` and `2017`  **!!! < THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT !!!!**
* **Key Internet Issues** Add the issues the project lead indiciated. Feel free to curate if you think another issue is better.
* **Looking for support?...** Add text similar to "If you're interested in contributing to this project jump in on the GitHub repository now or join us during #mozsprint June 1-2, 2017!" Feel free to remix!
* **Link for people to get involved.** Add a link to the `mozsprint` label on GitHub. It should be `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/labels/mozsprint`
* **Project image** Upload the image the project lead provided on the issue

#### How to reassign a project
If you think a project is better suited for another community, tag another wrangler in the comments.
