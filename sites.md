# Wrangling Sites for Global Sprint

Reveiew the [Site Hosts info](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/projects/). Each Hub should aim to bring 5 sites to the Sprint. The more Sites you run, the 

### Workflow for Sites

2. SH receives email with link to issue template & checklist. Designated Hub Contact (HC) is automatically cc'ed.
3. HC creates at Ti.to event for the Site, and adds Site Host as administrator. 

### About Sites
While lots of Global Sprint activity happens online, the Sites are  a physical space where project leads gather to work on the Sprint. Just as with MozFest and other face to face events, this is an amazing opportunity for your communities to get together, work together, network and create new relationships as well as strengthing existing relationships. 

A Site needs good workspace for participants, and an internet connnectionâ€“ preferably good, strong Wi-Fi. Partner organizations, groups, and institutions may have space available, and a built-in audience. If you're just starting a relationship with an group or org, running a small Site at the Sprint could be a good first collaborative event. If community members are local to a Mozilla office, you might take advantage of space, A/V equipment and the built-in audience there, while making some new x-org and MoCo-MoFo connections. **We don't currently have any financial resources to support Sites (for example, to pay for rentals of space or equipment or snacks) but we do provide some signage and swag for participants. ***

### About Site Hosts
Your Site Hosts should be prepared to create a welcoming space for all participants. Ideally, Site Hosts are well-connected natural networkers who can really promote the Sprint and their site across their communities and networks via social media, email lists, blogging, etc. Site hosts should also be prepared coordinate communications with their Site and the rest of the Sprint during the event, via Vidyo check ins and social media updates.
