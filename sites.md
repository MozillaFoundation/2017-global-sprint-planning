# Wrangling Sites for Global Sprint

Reveiew the [Site Hosts info](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/projects/).
Each Hub should aim to bring 3-5 Sites or more, to the Sprint. More Sites means more participation, project work, and community building!

### Workflow for Sites

1. Aspiring Site Host (SH) fills out the Site Host Registration with checkbox for Hub affiliation
2. SH receives email with link to issue template & checklist. Designated Hub Contact (HC) is automatically cc'ed.
3. HC creates at Ti.to event for the Site, and adds SH as administrator. 
4. Event is automatically added to our Site Map, and participants can register to attend. 
5. SH monitors the Ti.to event throughout registration
6. As event date nears, HC sends out swag packs and signage templates to Site Hosts, and generally answers questions.

### About Sites
While lots of Global Sprint activity happens online, the Sites are  a physical space where project leads gather to work on the Sprint. A Site needs good workspace for participants, and an internet connnectionâ€“ preferably good, strong Wi-Fi.

Just as with MozFest and other face to face events, this is an amazing opportunity for your communities to get together, work together, network and create new relationships as well as strengthing existing relationships. Some of your partner organizations, groups, and institutions may have space available, and a built-in audience. If you're just starting a relationship with an group or org, running a small Site at the Sprint could be a good first collaborative event. **If community members are local to a Mozilla office, you might take advantage of space, A/V equipment and the built-in audience there, while making some new x-org and MoCo-MoFo connections.**

We don't currently have any financial resources to support Sites (for example, to pay for rentals of space or equipment or snacks) but we do provide support, signage, and swag for participants.

### About Site Hosts
Your Site Hosts should be prepared to create a welcoming space for all participants, and help to enforce Participation Guidelines. Ideally, Site Hosts are,

* *reliable* and responsible
* *welcoming* and approachable
* *well-connected, natural networkers* who can really promote the Sprint via social media, email lists, blogging, etc. 
* * relatively tech-savvy* and prepared coordinate communications with their Site

You'll know who in your community would be best suited to be a Site Host-- reach out and encourage them to register!
