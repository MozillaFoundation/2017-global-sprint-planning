# Hub Participation in the GLobal Sprint

In 2017, we're building out the global sprint with all the Hubs to create a truly diverse and far reaching event, bringing together contributors from all corners of the network-- educators, devs, activists and designers-- to collaborate on code, curriculum, and tools.

Check out the [community-facing Global Sprint Site]() here.

When your Hub participates in the Global sprint, you:

* Energize community projects and push them forward
* Strengthen connections within your community and create new connections across Mozilla
* Support those from your community taking part in Open Leadership training, which culminates in leading Global Sprint projects
* Hear voices and see faces from around Mozillaâ€™s diverse global community
* Spark interest and prepare projects and participants for further collaboration in your own hubs and across the network
* Supercharge your MozFest presence-- successful Sprint project leads make well-prepared Mozfest session presenters and active, engaged participants

### How can my Hub and my communities participate?
Anyone from across the network can join the Global sprint as a Project Lead, a Site Host, a Participant/Contributor, or a combination of roles. On the site we have instructions and info for each role. 

* Project Leads bring their projects to the Sprint and facilitate contributions 
* Site Hosts coordinate a local work space
* Participants pitch in their varied amaizng skills and energy to push Sprint projects forward
