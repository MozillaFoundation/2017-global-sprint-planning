Selecting Projects for the Global Sprint

When you bring an open project to the Sprint, you’ll be welcoming contributions from a diverse, skilled and passionate group of people from around Mozilla’s Network.


Any project entered in the sprint should:
* have a designated lead who can lead the work before and during the sprint
* allow and welcome contributions by Sprint participants
* support the open web and a healthy internet.
