## Selecting Projects for the Global Sprint

### The basics
Any project entered in the sprint should:
* have a designated *project lead* who can lead the work before and during the sprint
* allow and *welcome contributions* by Sprint participants
* support the open web and a healthy internet.

### About Project Leads
The project lead role is key for a successful run in the Global Sprint! Leads should be committed to putting in prep time to get their projects ready for contribution (see below). They must be present throughout the Sprint to welcome both in-person and online contributors, answer questions, coordinate work and troubleshoot, approve sumbissions and pull requests, and generally be an enthusiastic, helpful, and patient presence. A project's Global Sprint is much more likely to be successful if the project lead is good at communicating with newcomers to their project, beginners who may have something to offer but might not be experts on the topic.   

Project leads should have a good understanding of "open," the importance of collaboration, and they should be familiar with some basic open practices. **We're very strongly recommending that all Global Sprint project leads do ["Open Leadership 101,"](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/open-leadership-101) a very short (1-hour) online course that introduces these concepts, as well as providing a bit of history and background on Mozilla and the Network.**

### About Welcoming Contributions
Every project in the Global Sprint should be truly ready to welcome contributions from a diverse, skilled and passionate group of people from around Mozillaâ€™s Network. Some of this welcoming happens on-site on the day of the Sprint, as described above, facilitated by a great project lead. But much of what makes a project contributor-ready is documentation and organziation of project materials and the process for contribution, in advance. Good documentation means any contributor can easily understand the project and jump in. 

We've created a handy checklist of items that every project needs to be registered and included in the Global Sprint. You'll see this includes a set of additional, optional items. These are tasks that project leads can do to level-up their open leadership skills and maximize participation. Projects that complete this next level of preparation become highly visible, FEATURED projects on our Global Sprint page, where potential contributors browse Global Sprint projects.  

ABOUT GITHUB
To participate in the Global Sprint, your project needs a GitHub repository! GitHub is an online, easy to use collaboration platform for collaborative managing changes to code and content


README
The README is your go-to project documentation file. The README explains what the project is, why the work is important, and how work currently underway supports the project goals. This introduces potential contributors to big idea of the project, what's happening now, and how any work they contribute will move the project forward. If you're not sure where to start with your README, [you can refer to this lesson](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/), part of our Open Leadership Training Series. 

CONTRIBUTOR GUIDELINES
These guidelines tell potential contributiors HOW they should contribute-- from the format and style for any contributions to  the steps required for submission and approval. Without this document, contributors won't know how to help out or where to begin, so it's very very important to have Contributor Guidelines on any Sprint project. If you're not sure what to put in your contributor Guidelines, you can refer to this lesson, part of our Open Leadership Training Series. 


CODE OF CONDUCT/PARTICIPATION GUIDELINES
This document outlines shared values and norms that contributors should agree to when they decide to join a given project community. Good Codes of Conduct should highlight positive community behaviors and values, like cooperation and honesty, as well as the describing negative or damaging behaviors, like harrassment or descrimination, that are forbidden. A good CoC encourages contribution by letting potential contributors know they'll be treated respectfully. Mozilla's Participation Guidelines are here, and Mozilla Science Lab's Code of Conduct is here. If you need help getting started, take a look at this lesson in our Open Leadership Training Series. 


ROADMAP
This document is an outline of work that's currently underway, and work that's planned. It helps contributors see the scope of the project and how the work will unfold. A roadmap should include "milestones" which are important chunks of work (like features, or units of curriculum, or stages in event planning) that move your project forward toward its end goal. If you need more info on writing a Roadmap [you can refer to this lesson](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/), part of our Open Leadership Training Series.
