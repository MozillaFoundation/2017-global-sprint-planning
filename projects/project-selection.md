## Selecting Projects for the Global Sprint

Review the [Project Lead](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/projects/) and [Project Requirements](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/project-requirements/) here.

### Workflow for Project Registration
1. Project Lead (PL) fills out the project submission form. Form includes box to check for Hub association/connection.
2. PL receives email with link to issue template & checklist. Designated Hub Contact (HC) is automatically cc'ed on this email 
3. PL makes issue; HC is tagged automatically to be notified that this step is completed
4. HC reviews issue, and add labels for tracks, comments on issue as needed to answer questions. 
5. If/when PL completes checklist to be featured project, HC adds project to Network Pulse with Global Sprint tags.

### About Project Leads
The project lead role is key for a successful run in the Global Sprint! Strong Leads will be committed to putting in prep time to get their projects ready for contribution and do some promotion. A project's Global Sprint is much more likely to be successful if the Project Lead is good at communicating with newcomers to their project... beginners who may have something to offer but might not be experts on the topic. **We are strongly suggesting that all Project Leads take [Open Leadership 101](), our short (1-hour) online intro to Mozilla, the Network, and working open best practices.**

**TIPS ON SELECTING PROJECTS AND LEADS:**
* You know your communities best, and you'll know those who are best prepared to lead. 
* Reach out to strong community members and invite them to submit projects!
* If an enthusiastic community member seems less prepared to lead, point them to [Open Leadership 101](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/open-leadership-101) or modules of the [Open Leadership Training Series](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/) to brush up on skills such as documentation, communications, and  community building.
* Pair enthusiastic, capable community members who don't have their own project with project leads who need more help.
