## Selecting Projects for the Global Sprint

### Review the [Project Lead](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/projects/) and [Project Requirements](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/project-requirements/) here.

### About Project Leads
The project lead role is key for a successful run in the Global Sprint! Strong Leads will be committed to putting in prep time to get their projects ready for contribution (see below). They must be present (virtually or in person) from 9-5 in their local time zone during the Sprint to welcome both contributors, answer questions, coordinate work and troubleshoot, approve sumbissions and pull requests, and generally be an enthusiastic, helpful, and patient presence. **A project's Global Sprint is much more likely to be successful if the project lead is good at communicating with newcomers to their project, beginners who may have something to offer but might not be experts on the topic.**  

**TIPS ON SELECTING PROJECTS AND LEADS:**
* You know your communities best, and you'll know the people that are best prepared and available to lead a project. 
* Reach out to strong community members and invite them to submit projects. 
* If an enthusiastic community member seems less prepared for some of the tasks described above, we do have a set of resources- Open Leadership 101, to start and the full Open Leadership Training Series, to brush up on skills such as documentation, communications, working with communities,
* Pair enthusiastic, capable community members who don't have their own project with project leads who need more help.
