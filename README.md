## Welcome to the 2017 Global Sprint Planning Repo!

Here you'll find all the information you need to coordinate your hub or community's participation in the Global Sprint, a 2-day world-wide collaborative work sprint on open projects from all around the Mozilla Network. At the Sprint, contributors and project leads gather in person to work, hack, and hang out together at local host sites. For those not near a host site, virtual participation is encouraged. In 2017, we're building out the Global Sprint with all the Hubs to create a truly diverse and far-reaching event, bringing together contributors from all corners of the network-- educators, devs, activists and designers-- to collaborate on code, curriculum, and tools.
 
 **This year's sprint takes place on June 1st and 2nd, 2017.** Check out the [community-facing Global Sprint Site](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/) here.

### Why should my Hub Participate in the Global Sprint?
Your Global Sprint participation can:

* **Energize** community projects and push them forward
* **Strengthen** connections within your community and create new connections across Mozilla
* **Support** those from your community preparing Global Sprint projects through Open Leadership Training 
* **Supercharge** your MozFest presence-- successful Sprint project leads make well-prepared Mozfest session presenters

### How can my Hub and my communities participate?
Anyone from across the network can join the Global sprint as a **Project Lead, a Site Host, a Participant/Contributor, or a combination of roles.** On the community-facing site we have information and instructions for each role (linked below). 

* [Project Leads](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/projects/) bring their projects to the Sprint and facilitate contributions 
* [Site Hosts](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/site-hosts/) coordinate a local work space and promote the Sprint to their local communities
* [Participants](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/participants/) bring their varied amazing skills and energy to push Sprint projects forward

### What can Hub Leads and staff do to help ensure a successful Sprint?

* **Recruit Sprint projects**  Direct potential leads to Global Sprint site and submission form. [More about wrangling Projects & Project Leads here.](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/2017-global-sprint-planning/blob/master/project-selection.md)
* **Recruit Site Hosts** Aim to secure 5 sites. Partner groups, institutions or orgs make great site hosts. [More about wrangling Sites here.](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/2017-global-sprint-planning/blob/master/sites.md) 
* **Recruit Participants** Get the word out! Blog, tweet, and post on your preferred social media sites about the Sprint! Highlight it in your community calls and other comms! [More about comms here.](https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/2017-global-sprint-planning/blob/master/communications.md)
* **Distribute Swag** Send out Global Sprint Swag (stickers, posters, etc) to site hosts and/or participants who request it.
* **Gather Data about the Sprint** Help collect metrics and assess the Sprint. **Your community's metrics can add to your Hub's year-end reporting, and show how you help the Network grow.** More about metrics and assessment coming soon!
